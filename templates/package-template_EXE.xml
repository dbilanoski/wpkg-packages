		<!-- NOTES 
		* Check available exe switches by opening the program folder in CMD, then executing .exe installer with /? switch (eg.app.exe /?)
			* this will show all available switches so you can plan your installation and deinstallation

		* If not practical to use the installer as a means of deinstallation, try options from below:
			* If application has a standalone uninstaller with fixed position, use that
			* You can use WMIC module by calling
				* wmic product where name ="<PROGRAM NAME HERE>" call uninstall /nointeractive or
				* wmic product where "name like '<PROGRAM NAME HERE>%%'" call uninstall
				* folder might need to be deleted manually (rd /s /q C:\Program Files\<PROGRAM FOLDER NAME HERE>)

				* To get program name, open CMD then execute following command and find your application name: wmic product get name
